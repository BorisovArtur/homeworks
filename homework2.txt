Solve a task with logical operators in such a way as on example:

Example:
let chocolate = true;
let strawberry = false;
let apple = true;
let caramel = true;

case 1: I want ((strawberry and chocolate) or apple) or no caramel
let icecream = ((strawberry && chocolate) || apple) || !caramel;
console.log(icecream);

case 2: I want (strawberry and (chocolate or apple)) or without caramel
icecream = (strawberry && (chocolate || apple)) || !caramel;
console.log(icecream);

TASKS:
1. case 1: I want pizza and pasta and (no capers or no tomatos); => the result is false
 case 2: I want ((pizza and tomatos) or (pasta and  capers and no tomatos)); => the result is true

let pizza = true;
let pasta = false;
let capers = true;
let tomatos = true;

console.log("case1: " + pizza && pasta && (!capers || !tomatos));
console.log(("case2: " + pizza && tomatos) || (pasta && capers && !tomatos));

2. case 1: (Number a is bigger than number b) and b is not equal to 0 or a is not negative number; => the result is true
  case 2: (Number a is a positive number or number b is a positive number) or b is not equal to 0
and a is equal to 7; => the result is true

let a = 5;
let b = 7;
console.log("case1: " + (a > b) && b != 0 || a >= 0);
console.log("case2: " + (a > 0 || b > 0) || b !== 0 && a === 7);

3. case 1: (Data type of 'one' is a string and (data type of 'two' is a boolean or number))
and data type of three is not a boolean => the result is false

case 2: (Data type of 'one' is a number and data type of 'two' is boolean)
or (data type of 'three' is not a boolean or data type of one is not a string) => the result is true

let one = 0;
let two = 'Hello';
let three = true;

console.log("case1: " + false && (false || false) && !true);
console.log("case2: " + (true && false) || (false || true));

4. case 1: (The new building has 9 windows or a door) and the guest name is John
or the address has a data type of a boolean => the result is true
  case 2: The new building has 8 windows or (no door and the guest name is John)
or the address has a data type of a number => the result is true

let windows = 8;
let door = true;
let guest = 'John';
let address = 5;

console.log((false || true) && true || false);
console.log(true || (!true && true) || true);

5. Find what char is bigger 'G' or 'g';
let a = "G";
let b = "g";
if('G' > 'g'){
  console.log("char 'G' is bigger than 'g'");
}else{
  console.log("char 'g' is bigger than 'G'");
}
console.log(a.charCodeAt());
console.log(b.charCodeAt());

6. Find what char is smaller 'K' or 'a';
let c = "K";
let d = "a";
if('G' < 'g'){
  console.log("char 'K' is smaller than 'a'");
}else{
  console.log("char 'a' is smaller than 'K'");
}
console.log(c.charCodeAt());
console.log(d.charCodeAt());

7. Find what is smaller true or false;
if(true > false){
  console.log(" false is smaller than true");
}else{
  console.log("true is smaller than false");
}

8. Transfer 7 to boolean 
console.log(!!7);

9. Chack a number 66 is odd or even;
if(66 % 2 == 0){
  console.log("Number 66 even");
} else {
  console.log("Number 66 is odd");
}
10.Chack a number 166 is odd or even;
if(166 % 2 == 0){
  console.log("Number 166 even");
} else {
  console.log("Number 166 is odd");
}
console.log(166 % 2 == 0 ? "Number 166 even" : "Number 166 is odd");
